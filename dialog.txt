First level:
- a single alien ship flies back and forth across the screen until the player shoots it.

Interlude:
- alien #1: the humans shot down our trade envoy.
- alien #1: this means war!
- alien #2: wait - couldn't it have just been a misunderstanding?
- alien #1: no one could be that stupid, not even humans.

- several alien ships come on together and make a declaration of war

Second level:
- normal space invaders style, 16(?) enemies

Interlude:
- alien #1: we lost all our ships?
- alien #2: this is an outrage!
- alien #3: the only thing these humans seem to understand is force. we must strike harder!

Third level:
- normal space invaders style, full screen of enemies
- some dialog while playing:
  - die, human!
  - soon you will be extinct!
  - resistance is futile

Interlude:
- friendly alien: wait!
- friendly alien: look... it doesn't have to be like this
- friendly alien: not all of us agree with him      [friendly ships get marked in green now]
- friendly alien: some of us are here under duress
- friendly alien: we don't want to make anyone extinct
- unfriendly alien: this... this is treason!
- friendly alien: what you're making us do is wrong.
- unfriendly alien: I'll have you all court-martialled!
- unfriendly alien: attack!

Fourth level:
- shoot the unfriendly aliens, but don't shoot the friendly ones.
- when there's a clear majority of friendly aliens, go to the 'peace talks' ending
- if too many of the friendly aliens get wiped out, go to the 'extinction' ending

Peace talks ending:
- friendly alien: enough!
- friendly alien: this madness cannot be allowed to continue!
- friendly alien: human, we apologise for attacking your planet.
- friendly alien: we would make peace with you, if you'll let us.
- friendly alien: and we will punish those responsible for this attack.

Extinction ending:
- you: there's... there's too many of them!
- you: they just keep coming!
- you: nooooooooo......
<silence>
